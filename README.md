# MYDICTIONARY Demo

[简体中文](./README.zh-Hans.md)

### 1. Introduction

It is a cross-platform CLI desktop application of excel-based and online dictionaries with [MYDICTIONARY](https://github.com/zzc-tongji/mydictionary/blob/master/readme/main.md).

### 2. Release

Get executable files for different platforms from [here](https://github.com/zzc-tongji/mydictionary-demo/releases).

### 3. Manual

The most important thing should be emphasized 3 time at first:

- **Press "\*" and "enter" to quit.**
- **Press "\*" and "enter" to quit.**
- **Press "\*" and "enter" to quit.**

Also, for better comprehension, please read [basic information](https://github.com/zzc-tongji/mydictionary/blob/master/readme/main.md#2-basic-information) at first.

#### 3.1. Configure File

Before using the application, configuration files in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) should be edited.

Such files could be modified by any editors of plain text, such as "Notepad" (for Windows) and "TextEdit" (for macOS).

Users could also use [JSON Editor Online](http://jsoneditoronline.org/) to edit them:

1. Open the default configuration file.
2. Copy the content to the left part of the webpage.
3. Click the right arrow, the content will be parsed in the right part.
4. Edit things in the right part.
5. Click the left arrow, the content will be updated.
6. Copy the content to the configuration file.
7. Save the configuration file.

##### 3.1.1. Configure File "mydictionary.setting.json"

Getting further information from [here](https://github.com/zzc-tongji/mydictionary/blob/master/readme/main.md#24-configuration).

##### 3.1.2.  Configure File "mydictionary-local-cli.setting.json"

Here is an example:

```json
{
	"autoSaveFile": {
		"enable": true,
		"timeIntervalSecond": 600,
		"notification": true
	}
}
```

When the application launches, *collection files* and *dictionary files* are copied to corresponding *collections* and *dictionaries* (RAM images). When the application exits, *collections* and *dictionaries* are written back to corresponding *collection files* and *dictionary files*. By doing this, the application can *record* *vocabularies* in RAM, which provides high running efficiency.

But here is a problem: if the application aborts, all *vocabularies* *recorded* by this run will lose forever. To prevent this, the application is able to automatically write back data to files.

`"autoSaveFile"` is designed to control the action of writing back. It has got 3 members.

- Boolean `"enable"`: If it is `true`, the action is enabled.
- Integer `"timeIntervalSecond"`: it determines the time interval (second) between two actions.
- Boolean `"notification"`: if it is `true`, the application will display the information when the action happen.

#### 3.2. Launch

Before launching the application, all *collection files* and *dictionary files* should not be used by any other applications, like [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/excel) or [WPS表格](http://www.wps.cn/product).

If the application launches successfully, users will see this:

```
(... bash ...) $ ./mydictionary-local-cli

[2017-06-06 15:24:54]

mydictionary-local

[2017-06-06 15:24:54]

(... the result of network checking ...)

[2017-06-06 15:24:55]

ready

TIPS: press "*" and "enter" to quit at any time
```

At this time, the application is ready.

If there is something wrong, the application will display the reason and quit, like this:

```
[2017-06-06 17:31:47]

incorrect format of file "(... path ...)/data/animal.xlsx": missing cell "Word" in row 1

[2017-06-06 17:31:47]
